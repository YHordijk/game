\newtext{Hello}
\clearbackground
This is a small demo for some things.

\newtext[name_input]{Hello}
\input{game.player.name, default=Edward, limit=20}
What is your name?

\newtext{Hello}
\choice{Yes my name is $game.player.name$:goto(post_name_input), No I want to change my name:goto(name_input)}
Are you sure your name is $game.player.name$?

\newtext[post_name_input]{Text Placeholders}

\set{game.player.gender='male'}
We can use text placeholders to add variables to our text. We can add them using \$enclosing dollar signs\$.
For example if our character is male and we want to use 'he', we can use \$they\$.

\newtext{Text Placeholders}
\background{castle_hall}
An example will be given now!

\newtext[introduction]{$game.player.name$}
Hi I am $game.player.name$. I am $game.player.gender$ and my pronouns are therefore $they$, $them$ and $their$.
Please call me $honor$ or $nonmarital$.

\newtext{$game.player.name$}
\choice{Male:set(game.player.gender='male')goto(introduction), Female:set(game.player.gender='female')goto(introduction), Done:goto(done)}
Now you can choose the gender of our player, try it out!


\newtext[done]{$game.happy_boy.name$}
Hi it's your friend $game.happy_boy.name$! I also have a gender: $game.happy_boy.gender$ and pronouns $game.happy_boy.they$, $game.happy_boy.them$ and $game.happy_boy.their$.
Characters can have any property, for example I have $game.happy_boy.hearts$ heart(s) right now!


\newtext{$game.happy_boy.name$}
\set{game.happy_boy.hearts = 4}
We can change most values in the game, for example I can set my hearts to 4 using \\set{game.happy_boy.hearts = 4}.
Now the number of hearts is $game.happy_boy.hearts$!

\newtext{$game.happy_boy.name$}
\set{game.happy_boy.hearts += 2}
I can also increase the number of hearts instead of explicitly setting it. For example, if we want to add 2 hearts we can use \\set{game.happy_boy.hearts += 2}.
Now the number of hearts is $game.happy_boy.hearts$!!!
