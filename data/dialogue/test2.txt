\newtext[start]{choice test}

Hello, this is a demonstration of choice dialogues. We can add choice dialogues using the \\choice{} command.

\newtext{choice test}
\choice{Go back to start:goto(start), Go forward:goto(end2)}
For example, here we have used \\choice{Go back to start:goto(start), Go forward:goto(end2)}.

\newtext[end2]{choice test}
\background{castle_hall}
You pressed the second option, so you were sent here. If you had pressed the first option you would have been sent to the start!
$they$

\newtext{}

\newtext{}
\goto{end2}
